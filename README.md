### Description

A simple tool for decoding resistor colour codes. I made this just because someone recently submitted a complex *text* based application (with no colours!) to do the same thing. There are a few of these already here on PSC but all the ones I looked at still used drop down combo boxes to select the name (thats still text!) of the colour. Thomas, I hope its ok that I borrowed your resistor.
